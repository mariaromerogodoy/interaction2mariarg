        <h1>The History of Typography</h1>
        <p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing. The history of typography dates back to the invention of writing systems and has evolved through various stages of technological advancements.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Early Writing Systems</h2>
        <p>Typography's roots can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Sumerians, Egyptians, and Chinese, who developed early forms of writing like cuneiform and hieroglyphics.</p>
        
        <h2>2. The Printing Press</h2>
        <p>In the 15th century, Johannes Gutenberg revolutionized typography with the invention of the movable-type printing press. This led to the mass production of books and the standardization of typefaces.</p>
        
        <h2>3. The Digital Age</h2>
        <p>With the advent of computers, typography underwent a digital transformation. New typefaces and design tools emerged, allowing for greater creative expression in print and web design.</p>
